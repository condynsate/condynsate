    "The study of ***optimal control*** is concerned with controlling a dynamic system for a minimum ***cost***. For example, determining what throttle inputs to use in a car to maintain a desired speed for the minimum amount of fuel consumption is a optimal control problem: you are selecting inputs to a dynamic system that minimize a cost. There are many types of optimal control problems, but the case where the system dynamics are linear and the cost is described by a quadratic functional is called a linear quadratic problem. We already have a linear approximation of our system dynamics, so if we generate a quadratic cost functional, we can define a linear quadratic problem. Let's do this now."
